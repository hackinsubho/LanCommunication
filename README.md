# LanCommunication
# LanLink
An intra-LAN text and voice communication application using Python. It can be deployed to enable communication between computers in a LAN. For example, it can be used to request a computer in LAN to share anything even if the identity of the owner of the computer is not known. This solves the issue of previously shared folders that remain visible even after their sharing permissions have been revoked. When somebody wishes to request the owner of the computer to share it, he could do so if LanLink has been deployed in the network as it takes names of the computers in the LAN and not custom usernames.

Features:-
* Chat communication
* Voice communication
* Broadcast feature from the server
* Separate GUI for client and server
* Easy to use
* Fast and speedy performance

NOTE :-
PyAudio has been used for voice communication purpose. It's quite a bit unstable but works fine. It has binding issues so at times you have issue launching the application due to it but it works great beyond that.
